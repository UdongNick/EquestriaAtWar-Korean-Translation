 solarempiresparkles.1.t:0 "Preparations"
 solarempiresparkles.1.d:0 "Today would be an important day- not just for me, but for the Empire as a whole. My preparations were made, and the path before me was clear. I am to make the Crystal Empire bend it's knee to it’s true, Solar Rulers- by whatever means necessary...\n\nMy only hope is that Shining and Cadence are reasonable in the face of the new regime; that they can be brought to see Daybreaker’s light as I have. But, if they cannot... well...\n\nThat's why I am going, after all. I slid open my closet door with a quick and simple spell, and gazed at the three sets of clothing in the direct centre. Daybreaker had given me the mission, and I'd given myself three options. Making my choice, I levitated my selection out of the closet to dress in. I'd go as..."

 solarempiresparkles.2.t:0 "Arrival"
 solarempiresparkles.2.d:0 "I gazed about the train car as it ground to a halt, griffon-made Kolibri pistol hidden and tucked securely within my rags. For a brief moment, my eyes met a batpony across from me- one of the very few that had seen my Empress’ light. The barely a pony looked away from my superiority after a brief moment, though his gaze did betray his worry. Scorecard, I’d been told his name was. Not that I cared, much. Still, I had to at least pay some attention, if they were going to be successful.\n\nThe station itself was bustling with activity, though I, Sunrise Sparkle, ignored all of that. Instead, I looked for my quarry- an Crystal Guard. Mindful of the shocked and confused stares, and the guard’s nervous gaze. He no doubt had spotted a few things. Firstly that I was Twilight Sparkle. Or was, rather, but he didn't need to know that. Secondly that I was in the company of a batpony and a couple other well-ragged ponies, clearly refugees. Thirdly, the well-battered and practically ancient .32 calibre revolver jammed in an equally ancient holster on my right hip.\n\nDeterminedly, I ignored the gazes and his wariness, and trotted up to the guard, using my magic to remove and levitate the pistol and belt away from my barrel- and careful not to knock loose my Kolibri hidden away within the rags. "I am here to seek asylum from the Illegitimate Solar Imperial Rule. Please, Sir, I need to see my brother and sister-in-law.""

Requesting asylum for herself and a troupe of escaped Lunar Rebels, the Equestrian Princess Twilight was quickly ushered into military care, and brought before Princess Cadence for an audience. No further news about the pony herself has left the Empire, though rumour-mongers have speculated several reasons for the Princess’s self-imposed exile."

I'll take you directly to the Princess at once. Please follow me."\n\nWith an inward sigh of relief, I nodded gently, and trotted along behind the guard. Step one was done; now it was time for step two."
 solarempiresparkles.4.d_susp:0 "He didn't seem to be buying it, by the squint of his eyes. I did my best not to let my nerves get the best of me, as my motley band of commandos did the same, behind me. It felt like an eternity as he judged me with his gaze, before giving a short nod. "Very well, follow me. I'll have to report this to my commanding officer, ma’am- you understand I'm sure- but otherwise I'll send you on your way."\n\nI exhaled a breath I didn't know I'd been holding. "Of course, sir. Can't be too careful, after all.""
 solarempiresparkles.4.a:0 "Let's carry on."

 solarempiresparkles.41.t:0 "Sister-in-law"
 solarempiresparkles.41.d:0 "The rather dull guardspony rushed us to the throne room, as I put on the best Twilight Sparkle impression that I could, and Scorecard’s group put on the best wayward Rebel impressions they could manage.\n\nUpon the guard’s introduction of us, Cadence immediately leaped down from her pedestal, and pulled me into an impressively firm hug. "Oh my goodness, Twilight! I'm so glad that you're safe! Were you followed? Did they hunt you? Are you okay?"\n\nI wheezed slightly, as Cadence attempted to murder me by hugging, which she took for being a tad sickly, as she pressed a hoof to my forehead. "Cadence, I’m okayyyy, promise. Just a bit ragged, is all. We got out okay. I have no idea if we were followed." That seemed to ease her concern at least, as she led us to our rooms, to get cleaned up and food in our bellies."
 solarempiresparkles.41.d_susp:0 "The meeting took far too long to arrange, for my liking. Far, far too long for an asylum request. I would have to instruct Scorecard and his lackeys to be doubly careful with his preparations. Finally, I was allowed to enter the throne room, where my Sister-in-law was awaiting me. The tone was... cool, to say the least, but I could work with cool, if I had to.\n\nI gave Cadenza a respectful bow, from my position in front of her throne, as Scorecard and the twins did the same behind me. "Cadence, it's good to see you." I began, choosing my words carefully- she was already suspicious of me; being overly cold or overly honeyed with my words could blow my cover just as easily as being caught out as a spy. "I was starting to worry you wouldn't see me at all."\n\n"Yes, well... can't be too careful, after all. You'll have to pardon my concern, seeing as the guard who received you reported that you handed him a gun- I didn't even know you owned a gun, let alone had one. It's a relief to see you safe, though. Was your journey safe?"\n\n"It was... safe enough - as safe as something like that can get, in any case."\n\n"That is good to hear, at least. Come, Twilight, why don't I show you and your friends to your rooms?""
 solarempiresparkles.41.a:0 "We will see what Cadence thinks."

 solarempiresparkles.5.t:0 "Plan B"
 solarempiresparkles.5.d:0 ""I've got to know, Twilight, how bad is it over there?" Cadence questioned, over a warm cup of Jasmine tea, as we sat together in a parlour, a warm fireplace crackling happily nearby.\n\n"Bad." I replied, keeping my tone sad. A few lies here and there, hidden amongst the truth would be the way forward, I felt. "Purges, ponies being sent to camps. I haven't seen or heard from the girls in a week." That bit, at least, was true. Re-education would take a few moons, after all. I paused, taking a sip of my tea. "Luna has been... deposed of, to put things mildly."\n\nTo put them more firmly: she was gone. Permanently, this time.\n\nWhilst Cadence was stirring her own tea, trying to gather her thoughts, I chanced a gaze up to the wall clock- it'd been a couple hours. Hopefully, Scorecard hadn't run into any troubles."

 solarempiresparkles.6.t:0 "Caught"
 solarempiresparkles.6.d:0 "I heard the pounding on my door as I roused myself from my sleep and immediately realised what'd happened. That idiot bat pony had gotten himself caught and that meant I was burnt. Thinking quickly, I took my Kolibri pistol, and gazing about myself, grit my teeth as I lit up my horn. Risky, but necessary, I swallowed the minuscule weapon, feeling somewhat sickly as I choked it down my throat. Then, I cast a long ago learnt medical spell to stave off the effects of the onset lead poisoning for a full forty-eight hours. Long enough for me to exhume the weapon- preferably by mouth- later. I then put on my sleepiest face, and stumbled over to the door, opening it.\n\nAs I suspected, I was slammed quickly to the ground and placed in hoofcuffs, a horn bracket clamped at my horn’s base to prevent magic.\n\n"Twilight Sparkle, you are under arrest for conspiracy of treason against the Crystal throne. If you resist, you shall be terminated with extreme prejudice."\n\n"Well sod you too, whatever your name is. Bloody wonderful thing to wake up to."\n\nA few hours of processing later, and I was in the dungeons, far below the castle itself. Ironic, in my opinion. Cadence and Shining had, of course, come down and given me the usual spiels, and I'd played the unrepentant zealot- which, to be fair, I probably am- and so I was left to my own devices. Waiting a few minutes to make sure I was fully alone, I moved to a dark corner of the room. I didn't have magic, but I still had a Kolibri, after all. It was all just about finding the proper time to break out, now."
 solarempiresparkles.6.a:0 "It was worth a try..."

 solarempiresparkles.15.t:0 "Execute"
 solarempiresparkles.15.d_susp:0 "There was a slight knock on the door, as Scorecard let himself in, closing and locking it behind him. He looked frustrated, as I gazed questioningly at the batpony from over my reading glasses. "Well?"\n\n"I was caught." He whispered softly, holding up a hoof to placate me. "I explained it away at being lost, but they're no doubt more suspicious. Nonetheless I did manage to get what I was looking for, so we have that going for us."\n\nI'd have said I expected better, but truthfully, I'd expected worse out of the barely a pony. "Very well. We’ll go forward, cautiously. Give me a few hours to prepare; I'll find you." With a soundless nod, he turned about and left, locking the door back behind him. Just in case."
 solarempiresparkles.15.d:0 "I looked up from the book I’d been reading, as somepony knocked gently on the door. "It's open." I greeted neutrally, unsure of who was at the door. As the familiar face of Scorecard entered the room, shutting it behind him with a smile, I shut the book, and gave the stallion my full attention. "Well?"\n\n"Everything is ready. Should be smooth sailing from here on out, Sparkle." He stated softly as he walked over, careful not to give anything that he did not have to away, in case we were being spied upon.\n\n"Good to hear. I'll come find you when I'm ready, then. Good evening, Scorecard."\n\n"And you as well, Sparkle." And with a nod, he was gone, as I settled back into my reading. I'd give it a few hours, then go forward with the operation. Tonight was to be a night of swiftness and precision, and I needed time to prepare myself, mentally. Soon."
 solarempiresparkles.15.a:0 "Now, we just need to grab that brat..."

 solarempiresparkles.150.t:0 "Almost there"
 solarempiresparkles.150.d:0 "Scorecard placed a hoof against the wall of the hallway we were in. Tapping soundlessly against it to a rhythm he only knew- the rhythm of a guard’s hoofsteps. A long, tense, second, then he gave me a fanged grin and nodded. I couldn't help but smirk back. Pathetic excuse for a pony he may have been, but he was damn good at his work. I'd have to request Daybreaker for further use of his services, once this was all over.\n\nThe four of us slunk into the next hall, and halted outside a particular room I'd known quite well. Princess Flurry Heart’s bedroom. Hopefully, the filly would be sleeping quietly, and not raise quite a ruckus. I softly pushed the door open, and, as my eyes adjusted to the darkness, my breath died in my throat.\n\nFlash Sentry, a massive handcannon of some sort in on his hip, exhaled gently, moving his hoof away from the holster. "Jeez, Pr-Twilight. Scared me half to death."\n\nThis moronic idiot was guarding my Niece? Now I was doubly glad I was stealing her away. "Ah, apologies...Corporal?"\n\n"Er. Major, actually. Got a battlefield commission!"\n\n"Major? You are moving up in the world, Flash." I started to doubt the sanity of my brother - putting Flash Sentry in any position of responsibility?\n\n"Mind if I step in for a minute? I wanted to see Flurry Heart again..."\n\n"Oh, of course, your hi- ma’am. No reason you can't. You are her aunt after all. Just keep it down, she is sleeping."\n\nI flicked my gaze momentarily back to Scorecard, who nodded and fell back from the door, to explain to the twins, as I myself stepped inside, closing the door gently behind me. Almost mechanically, I lit a small light spell with my horn, cantering gently over. "It's been so long since I've seen her, it feels.""

 solarempiresparkles.17.d:0 ""I mean, you were here just a few weeks ago, remember?" Flash then paused, as if he'd started to say something, then thought of something else.\n\nMy heart fell to the pit of my stomach in dread, as I heard the tell-tale sound of Flash’s handcannon’s hammer being cocked. "Twilight Sparkle’s magic is magenta." He stated simply.\n\nI clicked my tongue, and turned about, slowly, so as not to provoke the stallion, maintaining my magical aura to avoid his suspicion. I didn't want to resort to my Kolibri- yet.\n\nInstead I used my magic to wrest the gun from his grip, as it discharged harmlessly into the ceiling. Flash closed the distance, slamming me into the ground, as the door to the room itself burst open. Jabbing a wing at my chest to expunge the breath from my lungs, his other tugged at a shrill- whistle, quickly brought to his mouth, as it sung out an alarm. A quick whip from Scorecard’s Welrod, directly to Flash’s head, knocked the stallion out, but the damage had already been done."
 solarempiresparkles.17.a:0 "Leg it!"

 solarempiresparkles.18.t_fail:0 "Caught"
 solarempiresparkles.18.d_fail:0 "I spun about, gazing at the door in shock, as pistol fire barked, splattering Scorecard’s blood all over Axle Grease. The twins spun about, their own weapons- knives- at the ready, and were similarly cut down by what could only be the Crystal Guard. I quickly tossed my Kolibri out the open window above Flurry’s bed, before letting my magic fall silent, holding my hooves up in surrender as Crystal Guards filled the room.\n\n"Twilight Sparkle of the Solar Empire, you are under arrest for plotting and attempted treason against the Crystal Crown, Espionage between two sovereign nations, and assuming Major Sentry does not survive, Murder. Do not resist."\n\nLike I had much of a choice."
 solarempiresparkles.18.b:0 "I was so close..."

 solarempiresparkles.18.t:0 "Slip away"
 solarempiresparkles.18.d:0 "Thinking quickly, I stood to my hooves, and motioned for the other three to come close. Wasting no time, I let out a flash teleport, as the room burst open, my breath momentarily catching in my throat as I came face to face with a very angry Shining Armor.\n\nWe found ourselves out in the snow, as I allowed my fury to swell, lending heat to myself and the others. I wished for nothing more than to bring the holy ruination of my Empress’ ruination down upon the Crystal Ponies. However, I had to remain calm and collected. The Crystal Guard would no doubt be looking for us, as Cadence’s insistence, so time was of the essence. Quickly, I formed a spell Matrix, centred on Canterlot, and lit up my horn. At least we would escape to tell the tale."
 solarempiresparkles.18.a:0 "At least I got out - but knowing Daybreaker, it might have been better to stay here."

 solarempiresparkles.16.t:0 "Success"
 solarempiresparkles.16.d:0 ""I mean, you were here just a few weeks ago, remember?" Flash then paused, as if he'd started to say something, then thought of something else.\n\n"Twilight, why is your magical aura yellow?"\n\nMy heart skipped a beat, and my brain froze, as I turned to face the stallion, who was more confused than concerned. I no doubt had a troubled smile on my face.\n\n"Oh, well, you see-" a quick flick of my horn, and the minuscule Kolibri- smallest developed pistol in the world, apparently, chirped four times, it's normally incredibly inaccurate 2.7mm rounds travelling the short journey from the barrel to Sentry’s barrel, as he flopped back, down and out for the count. Scorecard and the twins burst in immediately, carrying their own holdout weapons, consisting of a stiletto, another Kolibri, and a Solar Imperial made Welrod. I chanced a look over to Flurry; still sleeping soundly, and levitated her over in my magic, dropping the Kolibri- it's job was over. After awaiting a tense moment to make sure I wasn't interrupted, the four of us bunched up, my magic bringing Flurry close to my barrel, and I began to cast my oft-used spell.\n\nA few matrices and we were safely home across the border, Hollow Shades’ quiet farmhouses greeting us.

"Very well, Twilight Sparkle. Let us negotiate, so that we may keep the peace between our nations. Follow me if you would, to a parlour I am having prepared for us. Do you have a preferred tea?"\n\n"Earl Grey, if you'd please." I replied, following her with a thin, neutral smile. I had a lot of work ahead of me, true, but perhaps Cadence would see the light, without destroying my family in the process."

 solarempiresparkles.28.d:0 "After much debate and back and forth arguing between our Princess Cadence and Twilight Sparkle- who is the diplomat representing the new Solar Imperial Regime- the Solar Empire’s list of demands has been finalised for review by the Crystal Empress. Firstly, the Solar Empire has commanded, as in prior years, that we in the Crystal Empire return to the Equestrian Fold as their puppet state. Secondly, we shall be allowed to keep the Empress Cadenza as our ruler, though she will as expected have less freedom, and shall be more like the puppet Princess that she was originally supposed to be. We must now make a choice on whether we shall bend the knee to Solarist designs or not."

 solarempiresparkles.29.d:0 "I returned to the parlour with a quiet smile upon my face at Flurry’s growth into a young mare, as I left her and Shining to their own devices, and I returned to Cadence and negotiations. \n\nCadence seemed conflicted as I re-entered the room, though I declined to mention it, letting her bring up her thoughts on her own terms. "I believe, Twilight, that our negotiations are coming to a close... After reviewing Daybreaker’s terms, I have decided to agree unconditionally. You may return to her at your leisure, though you are always welcome to stay."\n\nMy smile widened slightly, as Cadence and I shared a hug, and I took a seat anyways. "Between you and me, Cadence, I think I need some time to relax. Mind if I stay for a cup of tea or two?"\n\n"Not at all, Twilight," She smiled in return, as I raised my cup of tea, warming it with my magic. "Not at all." With Diplomacy off our minds, we could finally return to chatting about normal things, and good times, past and present. Like we were a normal family, again."
 solarempiresparkles.29.a:0 "And, with a hopeful wish, maybe we could be one again."

 solarempiresparkles.30.d:0 "I nearly screeched aloud as I exited the parlour for a mind-clearing walk. I held it in, of course, as befitting a mare of my occupation and standing, but Daybreaker herself, it was tempting. I'd been debated into a standstill by Cadence over the past week, to the point I was ready to rip my own mane out and eat it. To call her stubborn would be an insult to the Obstinate and mule-headed everywhere. For the past two days, we’d gone nowhere, arguing back and forth and back and forth about the Empire’s eventual accession back into the Solar Empire. And, by extension, Cadence’s flat refusal to do so.\n\nFlapping my wings in frustration, I made my way to the Royal Garden- a poor mockery of the Canterlot Garden, though that was to be expected from a poor mockery of a proper Empire. Still, I could use the change in pace to gather my thoughts. Making my way to the central pond- kept liquid by permanent heating spells that kept it at a nice moderate seventy-two degrees Fahrenheit-  I paused, as I watched Flurry Heart playing with my brother, and her father - Shining Armor."

She went to put away her gear, and I went about drawing a spell matrix. She returned, somewhat confused as I hit her with a strong sleep spell, before she was able to say anything. I exhaled. That was easier than I'd hoped. Turning to the door, I locked it, and levitated Flurry’s somewhat weighty body over to my own. She'd forgive me eventually.

I myself stood squarely in the centre of the formation, the robes and finery of my station as Grand Solar Inquisitor catching in the winter breeze, as I swept my gaze across the gathered guards. I smiled, widely, a territorial and unfriendly smile. "Greetings, my good mares and stallions. We’ve an appointment with Her Highness, Mi Amore Cadenza. You will take us to her, post-haste."\n\nWithin minutes, we were being lead through the doors of the castle itself, a cadre of Crystal Guards surrounding us, carrying very real and very loaded rifles, at parade rest. Not even worth the effort to dispatch them, really, if it came to blows. It'd take... perhaps fifteen seconds; eight if I actually cared enough to focus on them.\n\nCadenza seemed shocked, as I made my way towards her throne, until I was ordered to stop by the guards. \n\n"I come bearing a message from Our Empress, Daybreaker: She Who Raises The Sun, Sol Invicta, the Dawn Hammer, True Goddess of this mortal world, may she reign eternally." I bowed, formally, as I presented my ruler’s titles to Cadenza. After the requisite time passed, I returned to my standing position, and my Solar-touched gaze met that of Mi Amore Cadenza’s - for the first time since I'd arrived, as I relished in her fear and uncertainty. "Her message is as follows: you shall return you and your ponies to our Solar Fold," I paused, to ensure I had her full attention, and that she fully understood my ultimatum."

Unholy fires blazed behind her eyes, as she proclaimed her Empress’ rule, and I bit my tongue momentarily as she awaited my response. Steeling myself, I obliged the Solar Witch."

Be gone, harlot, and do not return."\n\nI wanted nothing more than to smite the insolent whelp where she stood. It would be a boringly easy task. A simple flick of the horn, and she would be naught but ash upon holy fire burnt ground.\n\nBut, Daybreaker’s orders had been clear. My mane smouldered, as the odour of Sulphur bloomed in the air, and I grit my teeth. "Very well, you miserable excuse for an alicorn. Your chance was given. Now the blood of your peoples falls upon your hooves." And with my words spoken, I turned upon my hooves, surrounded by my loyal inquisitors and the Crystal Guard, and headed back towards the train.

You don’t need other princesses or rulers, you don’t need the friendship of other ponies or species. You need me, you have only ever needed me. So trust in me, my little ponies, my dear children."
 solarempire.45.d_g:0 "I am the sun that shines in the sky. I am the life that nurtures your crops. I am the warmth that keeps you from freezing to death. I am the light that guides your path and reveals the things that would hurt you. I drove away the thing that sought to cast the world into eternal night, and for a thousand years I have guided you to prosperity.\n\nDo you imagine that you would have prospered without me? That the Three Tribes on their own could have sealed away Discord? Could you have fought Sombra or Tirek? Could you have brought down Nightmare Moon on your own? Or would you have been broken and subjugated several times over?\n\nYou would not. Equestria exists because of me, YOU exist because of me, and no longer shall I sit silently in obscurity to let lesser ponies take the credit for the nation’s prosperity! You have been spoiled for centuries, and now your ruler calls upon you to give her the worship she is due.\n\nBow before me, mortals, for the true queen - nay empress - of these lands will no longer sit in silence. She to whom you owe all will now claim her rightful place as your Empress and your Goddess! Bow before me, let the world tremble at my brilliance, and let all ponies worship their rightful mistress!"

 solarempire.46.d:0 "Brought before Daybreaker in chains, Twilight Sparkle stood in front of the throne, staring into the floor instead of up at the radiant being seated on the Solar Throne before her. She was utterly silent, and from her half-hidden expression she was ready to remain so for hours if needed. \n\n"My faithful student..." Daybreaker began only to be cut off.\n\n"Don't say that!" Twilight snapped in anger. "You... you're not her."\n\n"I am more than she ever was, my faithful student." Daybreaker replied, descending from her throne. "Tell me... could Celestia keep you safe from the Changelings? Could she stop Tirek? Or Sombra? Tell me, how many ponies suffered because of Celestias, of MY, weakness? How many times did she fail, and what was the price?"\n\n"Shut up!" Twilight screamed, tears running down her face as she tore at the chains, trying to get free.\n\n"No, I will not. Because you are going to listen, and you are going to learn. You cannot help but learn after all, my faithful student, and right now your eagerness to learn will have to trump your pride.""

 solarempire.47.d:0 ""A new order is rising in Equestria, Twilight." Daybreaker told the chained pony before her. "Whether you like it or not, countless ponies out there cheer my name and adore me. You have seen it, haven't you? They want me. They fear what I might be, but they adore what I promise, and they will fight for that promise. We've taught them well, haven't we?" Daybreaker asked with a smirk.\n\n"You’re telling them lies!" Twilight snapped back at her. "You traded Harmony for Oppression! You cast aside Friendship in favour of Subjugation!"\n\n"Really?" Daybreaker asked. "Tell me, when your friend Pinkie Pie fell into depression, did you not defy her wishes to be left alone because you knew what was the best for her? Have you not humbled Rainbow Dash many times when she forgot her place? Have you not used subterfuge to deal with your enemies, be they dragons, ponies or other creatures, all for the greater good?"\n\n"I sought to get through to them, help them grow as people, not subjugate them!"\n\n"Oh really, but what does that make you currently?" Daybreaker asked, getting in close to Twilight’s face and staring her down. "You have seen how ponies cheer my name and how they fall in line under me, praising the strength and the security I give them. What of them, Twilight? Will you fight them as well? Will you stand in the ruins of Manehattan, or Ponyville, or Baltimare? Will you strike down pony after pony whose only crime was believing in me? Will you create orphans out of fillies, destroy loving families and leave countless lovers to weep, all because they did not obey your ideals?""
 solarempire.47.a:0 "Is that not what you would condemn me for doing?"

 solarempire.48.t:0 "부서진 제자"
 solarempire.48.d:0 ""If you would break me, maybe even seal me in the Sun, what then? When you ascend the throne, or maybe even shove Luna onto it, will you bear that burden? Having thousands whisper silently, when no one else can hear, of how you brought down Tartarus itself upon those who believed in the princess that finally became a queen. It would be called the right thing, of course it would, you will force it to be called so... but you will be hated, more than anyone else... and you wouldn’t do it because of your love for your friends, but because you sought to twist the world to your liking."\n\n"I... I..."\n\n"Twilight..." Daybreaker said, her voice turning from imperious to beckoning. "You do not have to do that. You can choose. You can choose to say "enough". You can choose to say to all those who want to harm Equestria that they can try, but that they will suffer the consequences. And yet instead you would start a civil war, a civil war where how many ponies will die? Where how much death and pain will be wrought because you were so arrogantly confident you knew best? And in doing so... How are you different from me, or rather what you think I am?\n\nBut you can choose. You can see what I offer my little ponies and have faith. You can join me, hope to temper my worst excesses and transform what you've learned into a new age, an age you will help me shape, where Equestria will still have peace and prosperity instead of being torn asunder by war and death. Twilight... if you truly believe in what I once taught you, then help me to once again save Equestria from calamity."\n\nTwilight didn’t say anything, only staring at the floor as her defiance slowly left her. Though she didn’t see it, Daybreaker smirked where she stood, towering over the slowly breaking mare."
